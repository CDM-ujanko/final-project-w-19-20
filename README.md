# Final Project

Sunday March 22<sup>th</sup> 23:59

For the final project you will create a website that fetches data from a remote API, you can use any API you like but some good free to use are:
Nasa API: https://api.nasa.gov/
Store API: http://5ceb36a60c871100140bf873.mockapi.io/v1/item

Note: If you want, and can, you can create your own API and use that.

You can use any library we covered in class or any other you came across. The only requirement is that you have to add an explanation to what problem did this library solve.


## Before starting the project make sure that:

- Accept the project.
- <b>CLONE</b> your project repo to your computer. (When cloning there is no need to set upstream)
- The only thing you need to do is <code>git clone URL-OF-REPO</code> into the folder where you want the repo.


## In order to receive full credit you must make sure that you have the following requirements:

- Your site must look presentable, you have to style it, the better it looks and the better the user experience the more points you will get.
- Your site must be responsive, you will use media queries to make it look nice on a phone, tablet etc (2 breakpoints minimum).
- You must have some sort of pagination, multiple ajax requests, that will fetch more data and show it to the user.
- You must implement some sort of filtering of the data that you are presenting to the user, search, drill down, checkboxes, etc.
- You must have at least 3 pages on your site.
- Your site must maintain state in between page and in between pages. It can be anything you want, user likes, user data, what ever make sense for your site.

## Extra credit points will be awarded to project that go beyond the initial requirements.
